### Welcome to my GitHub profile  👋
___
I am a computer engineering student very interested in the whole world of programming. I am currently focused on web programming, specifically with Spring Boot 🍃 as a framework in Back-end and ReactJS ⚛️ in Front-end. Nonetheless, I am always interested in learning new things and try to improve as much as possible.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Bosonit](https://bosonit.com/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microservices, Domain Driven Design and Amazon Web Services.
